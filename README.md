# Svelte + Vite + Routify + Tailwind JIT
> This template should help get you started developing with Svelte in Vite.

This is a starter I want to use to replace the defacto Rollup starter provided by Svelte, which is verbose and slow as hell for development purposes.

## Features
- [x] Svelte
- [x] Vite
- [x] Prettier
- [x] ESLint
- [x] Aliasing
- [x] Netlify SPA
- [x] Tailwind JIT
- [ ] Routify

P.S. Currently Routify doesn't work in Dev mode. I have raised issues in both Vite & Routify repos.
